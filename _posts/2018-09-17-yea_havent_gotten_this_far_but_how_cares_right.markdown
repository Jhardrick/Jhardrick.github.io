Per my previous post, I'm still near the begining. I have no idea what I'm going to do. So I guess I keep typing this drivel until they yank all $9,000 out of my account. Anyway, I'm about to lose my temp job, I don't know if/when I will get another one so I don't know if I will keep doing this. But at least the Flatiron CEO will get to still live like a fat rat.
