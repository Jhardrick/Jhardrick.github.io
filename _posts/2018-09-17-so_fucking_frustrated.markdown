I didn't get much of an introduction to Web Development when I started this journey. The bootcamp didn't really help me to understand how the school curriculum works. I was typing in stuff in the wrong places but the bootcamp program never corrected me. I got into the program anyway and have struggled ever since. I've used Ask A Question a few times and even got a tutor. But so far, two current students who I asked for help have advised me to quit even though I'm not that far along in the course. I wish someone would have told me this before I had sunk $3,000 that I deperately need to survive into this.

A bit of background: I was laid off from my AP job back in February. This makes the 4th lay off in about 5 years. I hate this work and I've wanted to quit for the longest. A friend suggested this school. I checked it out on the internet and decided to try it. I wasn't sure if I qualified for a student loan (my credit isn't so great) but with the temping and my weekend gig, I figured I could handle the monthly payments. It is an investment that I am hoping will lead to a career that will finally provide enough income so that I don't have to work 7 days a week and will let me actually have a life outside of the job. 

I lost my internet access when I got laid off so I've been using the internet access at the WeWork near the White House. It's very difficult not because of the location but because the hours and travel time for both jobs keeps me very tired. I don't think being sleep deprived is a good way to try to learn a new skill but there isn't much I can do unless I land a permanent job that pays me enough so that I can get rid of the weekend job. 

To sum things up: I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. I haven't solved anything on my own but hey! At least Flatiron got it's montly payment from me. Hope this helps Avi purchase another mansion and yacht. I've at least accomplised that.
