I started in the accounting field in 2000. Never done it before but a nice co-worker knew I needed a job so she put in a good word for me and I got a position in the accounts payable department. I never pursued an accounting degree because I either didn't have the time or I was out of work. Frankly, the position never suited me. Most of the time you are chasing people to submit paperwork that you need so that you can get a bill paid. The hours were long and the pay was awful. The work/life balance was so skewed that for over a decade, I haven't done much but go from work to home. 

Now I find myself inbetween jobs again. Only this time I decided to look into pursuing another career. To be honest, I was thinking of getting an associate degree in the medical field but that would require that I stop work so that I could complete this in 2 years or less and that wasn't an option. About a month ago, a friend of mine mentioned the Flatiron school. I don't know how she heard about it but she was going to recommend this school to her sister who is also going through a rough job patch. I did my research online to see if this is a scam and I couldn't find much in the way of negative reviews. Since I've joined, I've found lots of support from staff. Some of whom went through the courses themselves so I feel like they understand what I'm going through. 

I'm hoping to have all of my course work finished by the end of December so that I can greet the new year with a more stable line of work that will give me more time to actually enjoy my life a little more.
